# About This Repository
This repository is a collection of several scripts I've been making helping me in different situations, like optimizing a faster workflow for posting to my blog, the GitHub actions I have in my blog, etc. I consider these scripts are not large enough to get their own repo because they solve a specific problem I had and maybe help someone with the same issue.

I will try to put a README.md on each folder containing a brief description of what the script do.

If you found an issue on the code or improve the script you are free to make a Pull Request to continue helping each other.
